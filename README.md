Coral is a project started from fun. 
Coral is a project based on the JDA (https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki), and is a discordbot manager. It has a similar structure to a spigot server, so people already knowing this kind of process will have a easy start.
The bot will have a few basic commands and features, but the really get the potential from Coral you need so called Coral-Addons. Those can be easily developed by theird-party developers. Also developers how has already worked with the spigot api will have a easy start.
This is the idea behind the project.
